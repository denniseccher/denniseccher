### ✦ About Me

I design and build meaningful digital experiences — with a strong focus on **usability**, **reusability**, **minimalism**, and **impact**.

Also building [**Eivy**](https://github.com/denniseccher/eivy) — a reusable Flutter chat component with clarity, aura, and soul.  
Exploring human-centered tools, ambient AI, and component design in Flutter.

### ✦ Philosophy

I believe in code that breathes —  
clear structure, scalable logic, and UI that feels effortless.

Minimal doesn’t mean empty. It means *essential*.
