### ✦ About Me

I design and build meaningful digital experiences — with a strong focus on **usability**, **reusability**, **minimalism**, and **impact**.

Also exploring human-centered tools, ambient AI, and component design in Flutter.

### ✦ Philosophy

I believe in code that breathes —  
clear structure, scalable logic, and UI that feels effortless.

Minimal doesn’t mean empty. It means *essential*.
